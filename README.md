# Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Project

This repo completes the week four assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data coursera course from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

## Data

Data came from smartphone human activity recognition dataset from SmartLab - Non Linear Complex Systems Lab. Samsung Galaxy S II phones worn at waist level collected accelerometer and gyroscope data on a group of 30 volunteers, 70% of which generated training data and 30% generated test data. 

## Analysis

The code was written to complete the assignment described below, which required that the test and train datasets be combined, with activity names appropriately labeled, variables be edited for clarity and mean/std variables be subsetted for further analysis.  The final dataset was the summary statistics of the mean value of each variable across each subject and activity type.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
